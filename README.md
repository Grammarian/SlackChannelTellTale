# Slack channel tell tale

## Overview

In any organisation, there are always new discussions and groups being formed. It can be impossible to even know
what people are discussing, let alone to keep up.

This app at least lets people know what new discussions are being created.

When a new channel is created, this app will send a notification to a configured channel:

![New channel notification](/images/sshot-notification.png?raw=true "New Channel Notification")

## Configuration

This app requires a couple of pieces of configuration, supplied via environment variables:

    export CHANNEL_PREFIXES="prefix1 prefix2" # only channels that start with one of these will trigger a notification
    export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="PUT_YOUR_SLACKBOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    export SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN="PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    export TARGET_CHANNEL_ID="#your-channel"
    export REDIS_URL="PUT_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL_HERE"

`CHANNEL_PREFIXES` is a whitespace separated list of prefixes. *OPTIONAL* 

A new channel name must begin with one of these
prefixes in order to generate a notification.

For example, if this is set to `"eng- biz- ops-"`, then a new channel `#biz-excel` would be reported, but `#pics-puppies` would not.

If this is not set or is empty, *all* new channels will generate a notification.

`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is the token that allows your app to post messages. **REQUIRED**

`SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` is the token generated by the Slack integration process to ensure that your app is working and authenticated. **REQUIRED**

`TARGET_CHANNEL_ID` is the channel name where the notifications will be posted. **REQUIRED**

`REDIS_URL` is the connection string for a redis instance. *OPTIONAL* 

If this is given, the bot will store
whether or not it has already processed a channel notification (Slack can sometimes sent multiple
creation events for the same channel). If this is not given, the bot will store this information in
memory, which is not very reliably since a hosted instance can be restarted at any instance.

## Slack integrations

This project uses Slack's python api toolkit: <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api>

You will need to follow the instructions given in that project about how to create an app for slack, and configure it to receive events from your Slack instance.

## Hosting

This app can be run locally, via ngrok. But, more normally, it would be hosted somewhere: heroku, zeit, aws, GCE.

The app is pure python, so it should be easy to host wherever you want.

I have had a good results using [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/tree/master/zappa ) to host the application 
within AWS Lambda.

## Local testing

Set up the above environment variables, then run it:

    > python app.py

When it is up and running, you can send messages to it. The `test-messages` directory contains some samples:

    > curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data @test-messages/channel-create-good.json http://localhost:3000/slack/events

You will have to put your `SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` into the json files, or your bot will reject them.

# Zappa usages

Activate the virtual environment:

    > . .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
To see the production logs:

    (venv) > zappa tail prod
    (venv) > zappa tail prod --filter "?ERROR ?WARN ?INFO"
    
To push a new version:

    (venv) > zappa update prod
